# The video game has been modified

Yes, with 1200+ Mods, the game has been quite changed. Here I will try to describe in the most comprehensive manner what exactly the list is and what is it's aim.
I will start with what the list isn't.

## What the list isn't

This is not a list for thieves, pickpockets, or assassins. Such archetypes and skill trees have been nerfed, why? I simply don't enjoy such builds and it is simply to discern those who wanted such a build to not play it. [RAID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2345) is set to High on both interiors and exteriors; no additional tools for assassins are added; unlike QWEST! which has Sneak Tools.
The combat, magic and gameplay overhauls are chosen for warriors, paladins, mages and wizards.

This is not a list for Legacy of the Dragonborn and item hoarders. LotD is not in simply because I do not like how it forces you to become an item hoarder. I made QWEST! for the ultimate LotD experience and now I'm making the complete opposite. 
LotD also displays the lamest armor and weapons mods in my opinion (IA/IW Hello). At the time you're reading this, Aldrnari may have way less unique items but that is bound to change.
You're free from hoarding random items; and you have cool playerhomes with room for displaying what you want, not what LotD deemed worth it.

## What the list is
### Beta 1 Goals

Beta 1 of Aldrnari is here to test most of the gameplay and quests. See if it's playable and fun while also bug-hunting. A lot of stuff is planned so sit tight if your favourite quest modificator, playerhome or armor isn't in. It may change in the future.
Please do not ask for exact names of what is planned, I simply won't tell you and ignore the question, you are warned.

## Gameplay - Combat | Engarde

The main combat overhaul of Aldrnari is [Engarde](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25673) - "Fixing Skyrim's melee combat one tweak at a time ".

It is one of the most diverse combat overhaul on Nexus, and a really fun one when mastered. Here I will describe a few core mechanics, but it has so many mechanics, I highly suggest reading and watching videos on it (or don't and figure out techniques and mechanics by yourself, at the price of a lot of deaths).

Unique Mechanics:
- Stamina Management: It is more on the Dark Souls Style; two or three slashes will deplete your full stamina and you wont be able to attack more, you will need to back off (and use the walk button) to regenerate a part of it. Power Attacks and blocking also depletes it. 
- Power Attacks: It is bound to a third button, detached from your usual click and it has a cooldown. No more power attack spam with a warhammer to kill every bandit.
- Off-hand: By default, if you have a Sword and a spell on your off-hand, using your left hand key will block and not use the spell. This allows dual wield blocking (which is needed in Aldrnari). To use the spell in your off-hand, press shift (by default) and your left hand key at the same time.
- Enemies actually use stamina, so if they spam power attacks, playing defensively will help a lot in early game.
- Weapons have different ranges depending on what type they are.
- Armors have resistances based on their keywords, if you use a dagger on a steel armor, it'll just bounce on the enemy. Same applies to you. 
- Dodging is extremely important, the default key is C (when following my MCM Setup) and will only work when weapons are drawn. The iFrames are generous and it'll get you out of trouble a lot.

### Gameplay - Combat | Other Combat Overhauls

The list doesn't only ship with Engarde, other mods come to make an ever more Dark Souls-inspired combat;
- [ZUPA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45182) forces 3rd person and plays an animation when drinking a potion, like how there's an animation for Estus in Dark Souls.
- [Smart Optimal Salves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42402) is an add-on to ZUPA, so you don't have to go in your inventory to have a potion!
- [zxlice BackStab and Parry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43436) is self explanatory! Backstabs; attack of opportunity after succesful blocks.. A really neat add-on.
- [Vanguard - Bash Behaviors Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52633) allows bashes to be different depending on the shields and also have different animations. It brings variety in the gameplay.
- [Heartbreaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1847) allows you to rip people's hearts. Metal isn't it?

### Gameplay - Combat | Enemies 

Enemies will be drastically changed; I have made a very thorought merge of many popular enemy overhauls, complete patched to work together. We are talking about mods like;
- [Skyrim Revamped - Complete Enemies Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14598) which buffs almost all enemies in the game.
- [Briraka's Draugr Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26188) and [Draugr Upgrades and Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21775) which makes named draugrs more unique and brings varieties like fire draugrs to the game.
- [OBIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145) the unavoidable bandits overhaul, with it's Patrols addon.
- [Better Vampires NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9510#) with [Ubervamps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28919) which makes them an actual threat. I also added my own, unique, non available on nexus mod; **Sovn's Ebony Vampires - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim**.
- [Heritage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30017) which brings more enemy variants to almost all classes.
- [High Level Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3231) which, instead of the usual more variants, adds level 60+ enemies into leveled lists. 
- [Real Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18183) because Skyrim Revamped does not touch bosses, for some reason, so it overhauls those, to make sure the minions aren't stronger than the actual boss.
- [SkyTEST](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1104) for animals only, so they are an actual threat passed level 5.
- [Splendor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9670) and [Diverse Dragons Collection] are what brings diversity to Dragons so every encounter is a new challenge.
- My very own **Sovn's Enchanted Spheres - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim** to bring some actual bosses in dwarven ruins.

# The video game has been modified

![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/qOPBy7D.png)

Yes, with 1200+ Mods, the game has changed quite alot. Here I will try to describe in the most comprehensive manner what exactly the list is and what goal its trying to achieve.
I will start with what the list isn't.

## What the list isn't

This is not a list for thieves, pickpockets, or assassins. Such archetypes and skill trees have been nerfed, why? I simply don't enjoy such builds and it is to discourage you from playing these types of builds. [RAID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2345) is set to high on both interiors and exteriors; no additional tools for assassins are added; unlike QWEST! which has Sneak Tools.
The combat, magic and gameplay overhauls are chosen for warriors, paladins, mages and wizards.

This is not a list for Legacy of the Dragonborn and item hoarders. LotD is not in simply because I do not like how it forces you to become an item hoarder. I made QWEST! for the ultimate LotD experience, so now I'm making the complete opposite. 
LotD also displays the lowest quality armor and weapons mods in my opinion (IA/IW Hello). At the time you're reading this, Aldrnari may have way less unique items but that is bound to change.
You're free from hoarding random items; and you have cool playerhomes with room for displaying what you want, not what LotD deemed worthy.

## What the list is
### Beta 1 Goals

Beta 1 of Aldrnari is here to test most of the gameplay and quests. See if it's playable and fun while also bug-hunting. A lot of stuff is planned so sit tight if your favourite quest modificator, playerhome or armor isn't in. It may change in the future.
Please do not ask for exact names of what is planned, just be patient and excited for the future, it will be a long development process.

## Gameplay - Combat | Engarde

The main combat overhaul of Aldrnari is **[Engarde](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25673) - "Fixing Skyrim's melee combat one tweak at a time"**.

It is one of the most diverse combat overhaul on Nexus, and a really fun one when mastered. Here I will describe a few core mechanics, but it has so many mechanics, I highly suggest reading and watching videos on it (or don't and figure out techniques and mechanics by yourself, at the price of a lot of deaths).

Unique Mechanics:
- Stamina Management: It is more similar to the Dark Souls Style; two or three slashes will deplete your full stamina and you wont be able to attack anymore, you will need to back off (and use the walk button) to regenerate a part of it. Power Attacks and blocking also depletes it. 
- Power Attacks: It is bound to a third button, detached from your usual click and it has a cooldown. No more power attack spam with a warhammer to kill every bandit.
- Off-hand: By default, if you have a Sword and a spell on your off-hand, using your left hand key will block and not use the spell. This allows dual wield blocking (which is needed in Aldrnari). To use the spell in your off-hand, press shift (by default) and your left hand key at the same time.
- Enemies actually use stamina, so if they spam power attacks, play defensively and wait for the moment to strike!
- Weapons have different ranges depending on what type they are.
- Armors have resistances based on their keywords, if you use a dagger against steel armor, it obviously wont penetrate the steel. The same system applies to you though, so play smart!
- Dodging is extremely important, the default key is C (when following my MCM Setup) and will only work when weapons are drawn. The iFrames are generous and it'll get you out of trouble a lot.

### Gameplay - Combat | Other Combat Overhauls

The list doesn't only ship with Engarde, other mods come to make an ever more Dark Souls-inspired combat experience;
- [ZUPA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45182) forces 3rd person and plays an animation when drinking a potion, like how there's an animation for Estus in Dark Souls.
- [Smart Optimal Salves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42402) is an add-on to ZUPA, so you don't have to go in your inventory to drink a potion!
- [zxlice BackStab and Parry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43436) is self explanatory! Backstabs; attack of opportunity after succesful blocks.. A really neat add-on.
- [Vanguard - Bash Behaviors Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52633) allows bashes to be different depending on the shields and also have different animations. It brings variety to the normally rather monotonous shield gameplay.
- [Heartbreaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1847) allows you to rip people's hearts straight from their chest. Metal isn't it?

### Gameplay - Combat | Enemies 

Enemies will be drastically changed; I have made a very thorough merge of many popular enemy overhauls, completely patched to work together. We are talking about mods like;
- [Skyrim Revamped - Complete Enemies Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14598) which buffs almost all enemies in the game.
- [Briraka's Draugr Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26188) and [Draugr Upgrades and Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21775) which makes named draugr more unique and brings varieties like fire draugr to the game.
- [OBIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145) the unavoidable bandits overhaul, with it's Patrols addon.
- [Better Vampires NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9510#) with [Ubervamps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28919) which makes them an actual threat. I also added my own, unique, non available on nexus mod; **Sovn's Ebony Vampires - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim**.
- [Heritage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30017) which brings more enemy variants to almost all classes.
- [High Level Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3231) which, instead of the usual more variants, adds level 60+ enemies into leveled lists. 
- [Real Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18183) because Skyrim Revamped does not touch bosses, for some reason, so it overhauls those, to make sure the minions aren't stronger than the actual boss.
- [SkyTEST](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1104) for animals only, so they are an actual threat passed level 5.
- [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) and it's Variants addon are what brings diversity and difficulty to Dragons so every encounter is a new challenge.
- My very own **Sovn's Enchanted Spheres - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim** to bring some actual bosses in dwarven ruins.

Those are only the most prominent overhauls present, the list isn't exhaustive.

"Wow Sovn, this is some madness! How am I supposed to survive?" Well listen here buddy, **the Encounter Zones are handmade**.

That's right, I heavily modified [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681)'s encounter zones. For the first couple levels early on, you will want to fight bandits. They should be as bad at combat as you. As you progress through doing [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) or normal quests due to [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751), you will get more enemies with more perks, and you will be able to do more and more stuff.

More on that in the next chapter of this guide.

## Gameplay - Leveling

Bandits are the best enemy in the beginning; they barely know how to fight (except their leaders) and aren't that organized, as you progress you should be able to tackle stronger enemies such as draugr, forsworn, mages, dwarven constructions or dragons, and finally vampires and dragon priests.

Vampires are deceptively strong, do not fight them early, you will get murdered. Why? Because the game is **semi-leveled**; lemme explain:
- Normal enemies still scale with you, they start at lower levels and have a lot of variants between lvl 1 and 90.
- Bosses are higher level by default, between level 15 and 250 (that includes quest mods). There is a lot of static bosses that are straight up god-like, I'm thinking Master Vampires and Dragon Priests.
- All enemies get perks depending on their level, a level 1 enemy has 1 perk, a level 60 enemy has 60 perks.

**"But how do you get to the higher levels yourself? How do you even train your combat skills if everyone kills you"** - I am glad you asked, let me introduce you to the 2 core mods for Player leveling:

- **[Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751)**
- **[Static Skill Leveling - Experience Mod Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30410)**

You will level up by discovering places, killing any enemy, and doing quests, your stats do not influence your leveling at all, that is [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) Here is what the add-on changes:**Whenever you sleep, you will be able to allocate skill points in the skills you wish to improve on!**. Only the first time you sleep, after you've leveled up and added your Stamina/Health/Magic bonus, that is why [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667) is in ([it also uses a bonfire, neat isn't it?](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41223)).

But that isn't all there is to help you on your quest to becoming a god among men, let's talk about the main overhauls.


## Gameplay - Main Overhauls | Perks, Races, Standing Stones, Magic, Religion and Alchemy

So I mostly play with **EnaiRim**, especially the full overhauls, and that isn't going to change *too much*. Lemme show you;

- **[Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137)** for main perks.
- **[Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245)** for werewolf perks.
- **[Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928)** for vampire perks.

They have been choosen because they enable many different playstyles and also make you very powerful, remember, we're not trying to nerf the player.

- **[Palladium Racials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43890)**

One of the deviations from main EnaiRim. Why? Because it allows both NPCs and the Player to use it's passive effects, and it has parts of Imperious, parts of other race overhauls. It will also bring a good diversity of potential builds.

- **[Mundustar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41674)**

Standing Stones overhaul with some drawbacks, I really wanted something different from the usual Andromeda, so i gave Mundusstar a chance, and so far it has yet to disappoint me.

- **[Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000)** for vanilla spells.
- **[Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)** for added spells.
- **[Forgotten Magic Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12711)** for reward spells. (more info below)
- **[Forceful Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276)** for shouts.
- **[Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612)** for artifact enchantments.

I really wanted a certain spell that loots bodies around you from Odin, so it's how this one got chosen over Mysticism. Many have suggested Arcanum in my old list, I'm giving it a chance here. Trust me, theres more than enough spells for any type of mage with this setup, so no need for apocalypse or similar mods! Forgotten Magic Redone's tomes have been **handplaced throughout the world, quest mod included, so they're rewarded at completion of quests and key moments in the game**. Let's be honest, that mod's spells are absolutely OP, and they're supposed to be lost, so why would a merchant sell them in the Bannered Mare? **This is why the readme tells you to deactivate the drops in the MCM Configuration**, nothing stops you from enabling them but would it be fun otherwise?

Forceful Tongue is used to overhaul shouts as I've never really gotten into Thunderchild, so I wanted something I'd actually use. In the total opposite mindset, Reliquary of Myth is used because it simply is so much more fun than Zim's in my opinion.

- **[Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)**

A religion overhaul that only gives you bonuses, so worshipping gods is actually useful toward build making.

- **[Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130)**

I have sworn to never use kryptopyr's CACO ever again, this overhaul does *exactly* what it needs to do and is actually not a pain to patch. This is why it has been chosen. 
Do not worry, I know [SAFO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12343) is in but it is completely overwritten by Apothecary, I've patched it that way.



You have all the tools to conquer the world thanks to the absurd strenght and overpowered items but those tools are also available to your enemies which will be ever challenging.

Now that the bulk of the gameplay has been covered, I will continue on the atmosphere of the list.

## Visuals - Atmosphere
### The 2 Options - Explications

The list uses [NLA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43166) as the weather mod, this choice shows a will of a bright, cold, atmospheric feeling, more on the realistic side of ENBs.

It was chosen over the usual Cathedral Weathers or Obsidian Weathers because I did not want something geared toward fantasy. But that doesn't mean there isn't an other option.

I also tested a more dark fantasy feel with [Apex Somber](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41598) which gave an unique look.

Before downloading anything, keep in mind all the ENBs have been manually tweaked by me to give an even better feeling than their base options. They are located under ``Installation Folder\ENBs``. Step by step installation of ENBs is [here](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari#getting-an-enb) but I suggest reading the following to have more informations on them.

ENBs being the most impactful part of the list, textures were choosen to have a more realistic approach of Skyrim, especially weapons and armors (that got total overhauls instead of simple texture upscales). I tried to have the best texture, nifs, alpha etc.. for the item in question; almost everything that is smaller than your hand will be 1K, swords and armors are 2K, and architecture and elements larger than you are 4K.

Because yes using 4K textures when playing at 1080p, when the mesh is wide, it allows the rendered object to not appear blurry, dragons and mountains are the first that come to mind. 

### Visuals - fnenb / Pacific Blue 

Those 2 ENBS are on the bright side.
- **[fnenb](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43998)** is more of a screenarchery ENB, it isn't good at every single moment, but it is so infrequent that I love it. It's lights are less blinding than the second enb but it is [brighter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/868966326566273095/unknown.png). It is made by Foxnne.
- **[Pacific Blue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44542)** is more clear than bright. That's where the difference is, but it's lights are blinding a bit more, like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/869238390468521984/unknown.png). It is made by FOSSTEN

Both of those enbs have a realistic vibe which is what the list aims at mainly.

### Visuals - Apex Somber 

**[Apex Somber ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41598)** by Digital Dreams has been a long time favourite of mine, for longer than the 2 above.
It changes the world into a [more grayscale shade](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/869559862479183922/unknown.png) while still being [bright](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/869564077586931772/unknown.png). It really has a unique vibe and it's interiors are [insanely dark](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/869560649892642846/unknown.png), in a dungeon it really makes you think twice on where to go.



Those are the recommended ENBs, and the only ones I know that fit the Weather/Lighting mod used in Aldrnari. You are free to try anything else on Nexus, but keep in mind the screenshots from the modpage won't match what you have in game because we use **[NLA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43166)** and **[Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158)**.

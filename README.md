# Preamble

Aldrnari (ᚨᛚᛞᚱᚾᚨᚱᛁ) is my project to make a Skyrim **I** want to play.
It is an ode to my love for folk music altogether, in fact, the idea came when I got curious into [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578) and started listening to folk music altogether.

Aldrnari means "the nourisher of life", it is one of the many ways to translate fire in old norse.
The idea came from the Heilung track [Elddansurin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xph2Phcj0LA) (it means [The fire dancer](https://lyricstranslate.com/en/elddansurin-fire-dancer.html)) because it represents how folk helped healing my soul and how in Dark Souls, fire is extremely important.
Because yes, this list is heavily inspired by the Souls Games, in the combat and gameplay mechanics, you'll see further below.

This list is made to be challenging, rewarding, you will become an overpowered Dragonborn who goes against terrible and fierce enemies. 
It is deeply inspired by games like Dark Souls and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, while having an artistic direction that comes close to screen-archery.

If you have any questions regarding the list, you're free to ask in the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) or [my own personal server](https://discord.gg/ZgjVrXp).

This project started as a collaboration between Althro and I on Tinvaak 2, we went in our own ways when we realised that our goals were different. Aldrnari still woudldn't have existed without Althro and Tinvaak 2.

### READING THIS README IN ITS ENTIRETY IS REQUIRED FOR THE LIST TO WORK. IT WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DON'T READ. THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE SO BE PATIENT AND READ CAREFULLY. THE README DOESN'T END AT "HOW TO START UP THE LIST". I am going to answer "readme" to any question answered in this document - you have been warned. THIS LIST MASSIVELY CHANGES THE GAME, AND I'VE PUT MY OWN TWEAKS INTO IT. YOU WOULDNT HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE IF YOU MODDED THE GAME YOURSELF WITH THE SAME MODS; THUS, DO NOT REPORT ANY BUG/ERROR/ISSUE/PROBLEM TO MOD AUTHORS BUT ONLY TO ME THROUGH WABBAJACK'S OR MY DISCORD.
